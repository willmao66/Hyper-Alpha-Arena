## Overview

Hyper Alpha Arena is a production-ready AI trading platform where Large Language Models (LLMs) autonomously execute cryptocurrency trading strategies. Inspired by [nof1 Alpha Arena](https://nof1.ai), this platform enables AI models like GPT-5, Claude, and Deepseek to make intelligent trading decisions based on real-time market data and execute trades automatically.

**Official Website:** https://www.akooi.com/

## Who is this for

| Who you are | What you get |
|-------------|--------------|
| **Non-technical traders** | Built-in AI assistants help you create trading signals and strategy prompts through natural conversation—no coding required |
| **Quantitative researchers** | Test LLM-driven strategies with real market data on testnet before deploying real capital |
| **Hyperliquid users** | Native integration with both testnet (free paper trading) and mainnet (1-50x leverage perpetuals) |
| **AI enthusiasts** | Experiment with different LLMs (GPT, Claude, Deepseek) competing in real trading scenarios |

**Trading Modes:**
- **Hyperliquid Testnet (Paper Trading)**: Risk-free testing with real market mechanics, free test funds, and actual order book - a superior paper trading experience
- **Hyperliquid Mainnet**: Live trading on decentralized perpetual exchange with 1-50x leverage support (real capital at risk)

## Features

### Two Trading Modes

| Mode | Best For | How It Works |
|------|----------|--------------|
| **AI Trader** | Strategies needing market understanding (news, sentiment, complex judgment) | Describe strategy in natural language, AI analyzes and decides in real-time |
| **Program Trader** | Fixed-rule strategies (technical indicators, price levels) | Define rules in Python code, millisecond execution, backtestable |

**Market Flow Signal Monitoring** - No need to watch charts 24/7. Automatically triggers when big money moves. Monitors order flow imbalance, open interest surges, funding rate extremes—activates trading only when market structure changes.

**AI-Assisted Configuration** - Can't write strategy prompts? Don't know how to set signal conditions? Conversational AI generators help you configure from scratch, no coding required.

**Trade Attribution Analytics** - Don't know what's wrong with your strategy? Performance breakdown by symbol, trigger type, and time period. AI diagnosis identifies weaknesses and suggests optimizations.

**Multi-Account Real-Time Comparison** - Don't know which strategy works better? Real-time asset curve comparison across multiple AI traders, with trade markers displayed on individual curves.

**Deep Hyperliquid Integration** - Seamless testnet/mainnet switching, native 1-50x leverage support, built-in margin monitoring and liquidation price warnings.

**Multi-Model LLM Support** - Compatible with OpenAI API models (GPT-5, Claude, Deepseek, etc.). Multi-wallet architecture with independent testnet/mainnet configurations.

**Program Trader** - Define trading rules with Python code. AI assistant helps write and debug code through conversation. Validate syntax, preview execution, and backtest before going live.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Docker Desktop** ([Download](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop))
  - Windows: Docker Desktop for Windows
  - macOS: Docker Desktop for Mac
  - Linux: Docker Engine ([Install Guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/))

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/HammerGPT/Hyper-Alpha-Arena.git
cd Hyper-Alpha-Arena

# Start the application (choose one command based on your Docker version)
docker compose up -d --build        # For newer Docker Desktop (recommended)
# OR
docker-compose up -d --build       # For older Docker versions or standalone docker-compose
```

The application will be available at **http://localhost:8802**

### Managing the Application

```bash
# View logs
docker compose logs -f        # (or docker-compose logs -f)

# Stop the application
docker compose down          # (or docker-compose down)

# Restart the application
docker compose restart       # (or docker-compose restart)

# Update to latest version
git pull origin main
docker compose up -d --build # (or docker-compose up -d --build)
```

**Important Notes:**
- All data (databases, configurations, trading history) is persisted in Docker volumes
- Data will be preserved when you stop/restart containers
- Only `docker-compose down -v` will delete data (don't use `-v` flag unless you want to reset everything)

## First-Time Setup

For detailed setup instructions including:
- Hyperliquid wallet configuration (Testnet & Mainnet)
- AI Trader creation and LLM API setup
- Trading environment and leverage settings
- Signal-triggered trading configuration

**📖 See our complete guide: [Getting Started](https://www.akooi.com/docs/guide/getting-started.html)**

## Supported Models

Hyper Alpha Arena supports any OpenAI API compatible language model. **For best results, we recommend using Deepseek** for its cost-effectiveness and strong performance in trading scenarios.

Supported models include:
- **Deepseek** (Recommended): Excellent cost-performance ratio for trading decisions
- **OpenAI**: GPT-5 series, o1 series, GPT-4o, GPT-4
- **Anthropic**: Claude (via compatible endpoints)
- **Custom APIs**: Any OpenAI-compatible endpoint

The platform automatically handles model-specific configurations and parameter differences.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Problem**: Port 8802 already in use
**Solution**:
```bash
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d --build
```

**Problem**: Cannot connect to Docker daemon
**Solution**: Make sure Docker Desktop is running

**Problem**: Database connection errors
**Solution**: Wait for PostgreSQL container to be healthy (check with `docker-compose ps`)

**Problem**: Want to reset all data
**Solution**:
```bash
docker-compose down -v  # This will delete all data!
docker-compose up -d --build
```
